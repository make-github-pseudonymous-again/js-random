/**
 * Shuffle elements of an iterable using an inside-out implementation of the
 * Fisher-Yates method.
 *
 * One can observe that if the input contains n elements, the loop has exactly
 * n! possible outcomes: one for the first iteration, two for the second, three
 * for the third, etc., the number of outcomes of a loop being the product of
 * the number of outcomes for each iteration. Given a perfect randint function,
 * each iteration's outcomes are equally likely, and independent of other
 * iterations outcomes. The proof below shows that these outcomes are
 * distinct.
 *
 * To see that this method yields the correct result (assume perfect randint):
 *   1. Observe that it is correct when the input is empty.
 *   2. By induction:
 *     - Induction hypothesis: assume it is correct when the input consists of
 *       n elements.
 *     - We almost insert the (n+1)th element at one of the n+1 possible
 *       insertion position in the output array. Almost because we move the
 *       element that is at the insertion position at the end instead of
 *       shifting the elements right of the insertion position to make room for
 *       the inserted element.
 *     - Ideally, since we inserted the last element at one of the n+1
 *       positions, we would like that the elements inserted earlier form one
 *       of n! permutations uniformly at random after moving the element under
 *       the insertion position. This is true because the permutations that we
 *       obtain after this move are in one-to-one correspondance with the n!
 *       distinct permutations that can be obtained before the move. These are
 *       equally likely to be produced by the induction hypothesis.
 *
 * @param {Function} randint The randint function.
 * @return {Function} The sampling function.
